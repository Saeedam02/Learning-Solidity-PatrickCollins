Lesson 7 : Foundry Fund Me

You can use "forge test" command to run a test file in your terminal.
When you initialize your file by forge init, it creates counter.sol codes in directories. you should delete them, because we gana write our own code and tests.

////////
In Remix we can import libraries or codes by for example:

import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3

remix automatically reaches out to the npm package repository. however foundry doesn't do this.
we need to be very explicit and tell foundry exactly where we need to pull our dependencies from.
we actually need to download that repository from github

for the AggregatorV3Interface we can use: https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts

for installing all libraries which we need, use: forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1 --no-commit
use @0.6.1 for the latest version 
After installing, it will gives us a path for where we're actually installing that.
But notice that we must tell foundry that @chainlink/contracts/ is refering to the lib folder. we need to create something called remapping.
go to foundry.toml and create new section called remaooing.

after doing all stuff, use forge build to compile.
