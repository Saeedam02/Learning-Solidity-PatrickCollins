Lesson 7 : Foundry Fund Me

You can use "forge test" command to run a test file in your terminal.
When you initialize your file by forge init, it creates counter.sol codes in directories. you should delete them, because we gana write our own code and tests.

////////
In Remix we can import libraries or codes by for example:

import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3

remix automatically reaches out to the npm package repository. however foundry doesn't do this.
we need to be very explicit and tell foundry exactly where we need to pull our dependencies from.
we actually need to download that repository from github

for the AggregatorV3Interface we can use: https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts

for installing all libraries which we need, use: forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1 --no-commit
use @0.6.1 for the latest version 
After installing, it will gives us a path for where we're actually installing that.
But notice that we must tell foundry that @chainlink/contracts/ is refering to the lib folder. we need to create something called remapping.
go to foundry.toml and create new section called remaooing.

after doing all stuff, use forge build to compile. and there will be an out folder containing all compiled stuff.

// the best way to named an error is starting with the name of the contract which is contains the error.
error FundMe_NtOwner();

################################ Test #############################
the forge standard librarie has a couple of standard packages or standard contracts that we can use to make our test easier.

from a test, we want to test that our contract is doing what we wnat to do or not.

In all our tests, the first function is a setUp function and inside of that we're gana deploy our contract.

Another way to test and debugging is something called console.log -> https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge-std/console-log

With command "forge test --vv" (vv stands for the visibility of logging in this test.it can be vv till vvvvv)
